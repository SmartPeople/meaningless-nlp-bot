## Topics


There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: **extraction** and **abstraction**. 

Extractive methods work by selecting a subset of existing words, phrases, or sentences in the original text to form the summary. 

##### Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation and then use natural language generation techniques to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express. Such a summary might include verbal innovations.

**ROUGE** (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) 

This is a recall-based measure that determines how well a system-generated summary covers the content present in one or more human-generated model summaries known as references. It is recall-based to encourage systems to include all the important topics in the text.
